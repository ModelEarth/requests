# Storyboard file sharing for “Active&nbsp;Reader”&nbsp;layouts

We love [FloraFauna's visual editing tools](https://www.florafauna.ai). It would be cool to import and export prompt storyboards and related files. The following script creates .csv files using location data to create prompts. The resulting files are pushed to GitHub, from which they're loaded into the side gallery via the Github API.

We're striving to increase reading rates for K-12 graders by creating layouts that encourage reading and creative writing during story visualization processes. &nbsp;The current page layout is structured to display prompted gallery images adjacent to related text.  We also display output within our [JQuery Gallery](gallery) and via our [FeedPlayer](../feed).<!-- or [React Gallery](https://model.earth/react-gallery/view/)  On narrow screen, the gallery appears above the text. Generated in different aspect ratios-->
