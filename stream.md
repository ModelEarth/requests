# Storyboard file sharing for “Active&nbsp;Reader”&nbsp;layouts

Flowcharts in [FloraFauna](https://www.florafauna.ai) and [ComfyUI's ](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started/introduction) provides editors with scene overviews. We're automating prompts for scene flow based on local industry levels and [related factors](../exiobase/tradeflow/). The following script creates .csv files using location data and pushes the results to GitHub, from which images are loaded into the side gallery (to the right) via the Github JavaScript API.

We're creating galleries that reside adjacent to reading material and prompting processes to increase reading rates for K-12 graders - during visual story generation. &nbsp;The current page layout is structured to display prompted gallery images adjacent to related text.  We also display output within our [JQuery Gallery](gallery) and via our [FeedPlayer](../feed).<!-- or [React Gallery](https://model.earth/react-gallery/view/)  On narrow screen, the gallery appears above the text. Generated in different aspect ratios-->
